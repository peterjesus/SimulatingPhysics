# SimulatingPhysics

Project focused on numerical simulations on didactic typical-physics problems.

## List of the analyzed problems

The list of the main solved problems is:

* `Logistic Equation and Chaotic Behaviour`  
* `Atomic Linear-Chain Vibration`
* `Molecular Vibration` 
* `Neutron Transport and Collision` 
* `Random Numbers`
* `Percolation` 
* `Fractals` 
* `Ising Model`
* `Particles Transport and Collision`

Additionally, there is an extra set of exercises about `Chaos Theory`, in which some topics like logistic equation(again!), dynamic systems, centers and fractals(Sierpinski carpet's fractal dimension) are coded.

## Notes

The description of the algorithms used and the mathematical tips employed for each problem appear (in spanish) on its corresponding documentation.
