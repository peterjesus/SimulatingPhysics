* `Atomic Linear-Chain Vibration`
* `Molecular Vibration` 
* `Neutron Transport and Collision` 
* `Random Numbers`
* `Percolation` 
* `Fractals` 
* `Ising Model`
* `Particles Transport and Collision`

## Notes

The description of the algorithms used and the mathematical tips employed for each problem appear (in spanish) on its corresponding documentation.
