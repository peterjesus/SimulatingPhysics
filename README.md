# SimulatingPhysics

Project focused on numerical simulations on didactic typical-physics problems.

## List of the analyzed problems

* `Logistic Equation`  
* `Linear Chain Vibration`
* `Molecular Vibration` 
* `Neutron Transport` 
* `Random Numbers`
* `Percolation` 
* `Fractals` 
* `Ising Model`
* `Particles Transport`

## Notes

The description of the algorithms and the mathematics tips employed for each problem appear (in spanish) on its corresponding documentation.
